Problem statement 

The problem at hand revolves around the need for a user-friendly and
efficient solution to aid individuals in discovering local businesses,
restaurants, and points of interest. In today's dynamic and fast-paced
world, people often find themselves in unfamiliar locations, seeking
nearby services or attractions. This challenge becomes especially
prevalent when navigating through new cities or neighborhoods.
Traditional methods of exploration may not always provide up-todate or relevant information. Thus, the objective of this project is to
develop a mobile application that seamlessly integrates the HERE
Places API and Mobile SDKs to empower users with a comprehensive
tool for finding and exploring local establishments. By addressing this
problem, the app aims to enhance user experiences, offering realtime, accurate, and personalized information about the surrounding
environment, ultimately contributing to more informed and enjoyable
local discoveries
